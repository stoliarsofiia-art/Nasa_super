HOW TO DETECT THE 7 METRICS FOR EXOPLANET CLASSIFICATION
(What Astronomers Actually Do)
================================================================================

The ML system needs 7 measurements as input. Here's how astronomers actually 
get these numbers from telescopes and observations.


================================================================================
THE 7 METRICS NEEDED
================================================================================

1. Orbital Period (days)
2. Transit Duration (hours)
3. Transit Depth (fraction of light blocked)
4. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
5. Stellar Mass (solar masses)
6. Stellar Temperature (Kelvin)
7. Stellar Magnitude (brightness)


================================================================================
PRIMARY TOOL: LIGHT CURVE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

The main method is called the TRANSIT METHOD - watching a star's brightness 
over time.

WHAT YOU SEE:
When a planet passes in front of its star (like a solar eclipse), it blocks 
some light. The star appears slightly dimmer for a few hours.

LIGHT CURVE = Graph of star's brightness vs. time

Example Light Curve:
    
    Brightness
    100% |‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾\_____/‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾\_____/‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
         |                                              
     99% |              Transit  Transit
         |              (dip)    (dip)
         |_____________________________________________
         0          5         10        15        20  Time (days)

From this graph, you can measure:
- Orbital period: Time between dips
- Transit duration: Width of each dip
- Transit depth: How deep the dip is
- SNR: How clear the dip is vs. noise


================================================================================
METRIC 1: ORBITAL PERIOD
================================================================================

HOW TO MEASURE:
Watch the star for weeks/months and count how often the planet transits.

METHOD:
1. Record star's brightness continuously
2. Detect multiple transits (dips in brightness)
3. Measure time between transits

EXAMPLE:
- First transit detected: Day 0
- Second transit: Day 289.9
- Third transit: Day 579.8
- Orbital period = 289.9 days

TOOLS USED:
- Space telescopes: Kepler, TESS, James Webb
- Ground telescopes: With adaptive optics
- Automated software: Find periodic dips

TIME NEEDED:
- Short period planets (1-10 days): 1 month observation
- Long period planets (100-400 days): 1-4 years observation
- Kepler-22 b took ~3 transits to confirm = ~2.4 years!

ACCURACY:
Very high! Can measure to 0.001 days precision.


================================================================================
METRIC 2: TRANSIT DURATION
================================================================================

HOW TO MEASURE:
Measure how long the planet takes to cross in front of the star.

METHOD:
1. Detect when brightness starts dropping (first contact)
2. Detect when brightness finishes dropping (second contact)
3. Detect when brightness starts rising (third contact)
4. Detect when brightness fully recovers (fourth contact)

VISUALIZATION:
    100% |‾‾‾‾\____/‾‾‾‾
         |     |  |
         |     |  |
         |     |  |
         |_____|__|_______
              A  B  C  D
              
    A = First contact (start dimming)
    B = Second contact (fully dimmed)
    C = Third contact (start brightening)
    D = Fourth contact (fully bright)
    
    Duration = Time from A to D

EXAMPLE:
- Kepler-22 b transit duration: 7.4 hours
- Short-period hot Jupiter: 2-4 hours
- Grazing transit: 1-2 hours

FACTORS AFFECTING DURATION:
- Orbital speed (faster orbit = shorter transit)
- Star size (bigger star = longer transit)
- Impact parameter (center crossing = longer, grazing = shorter)

TOOLS:
- High-precision photometry
- 30-minute cadence observations (Kepler)
- 2-minute cadence (TESS)

ACCURACY:
±0.1 to 0.5 hours depending on data quality


================================================================================
METRIC 3: TRANSIT DEPTH
================================================================================

HOW TO MEASURE:
Calculate how much dimmer the star gets during transit.

METHOD:
1. Measure star's normal brightness (baseline)
2. Measure star's brightness during transit (minimum)
3. Calculate: depth = (baseline - minimum) / baseline

FORMULA:
    Transit depth = ΔF / F
    
    Where:
        ΔF = change in brightness
        F = normal brightness

EXAMPLE:
- Normal brightness: 1,000,000 photons/second
- During transit: 995,080 photons/second
- Depth = (1,000,000 - 995,080) / 1,000,000
- Depth = 4,920 / 1,000,000
- Depth = 0.00492 = 0.492%

PHYSICAL MEANING:
Transit depth tells you planet size!
    depth = (R_planet / R_star)²

For Kepler-22 b:
    0.00492 = (R_planet / R_star)²
    sqrt(0.00492) = R_planet / R_star
    0.0701 = R_planet / R_star
    
    If star is Sun-sized (1 R☉ = 109.1 R⊕):
    R_planet = 0.0701 × 109.1 = 7.6 Earth radii

DETECTION LIMITS:
- Kepler: Can detect depths down to 0.001% (10 ppm)
- TESS: Down to 0.01% (100 ppm)
- Ground telescopes: Down to 0.1% (1000 ppm)

CHALLENGES:
- Earth-sized planet: ~0.008% depth (hard to detect!)
- Jupiter-sized planet: ~1% depth (easier)
- Must remove stellar noise, systematic errors


================================================================================
METRIC 4: SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO (SNR)
================================================================================

HOW TO MEASURE:
Compare the transit signal to the noise level in the data.

METHOD:
1. Measure the depth of the transit (signal)
2. Measure the scatter in the light curve outside transits (noise)
3. Calculate: SNR = Signal / Noise

FORMULA:
    SNR = (Transit depth) / (Noise level) × sqrt(Number of transits)

EXAMPLE:
- Transit depth: 0.00492 (signal)
- Noise in light curve: 0.0004 (per measurement)
- Number of measurements in transit: 15
- Number of transits observed: 3

    SNR = (0.00492 / 0.0004) × sqrt(15) × sqrt(3)
    SNR = 12.3 × 3.87 × 1.73
    SNR ≈ 12 ✓

WHAT SNR MEANS:
- SNR > 20: Excellent detection, very confident
- SNR 10-20: Good detection, reliable
- SNR 7-10: Marginal detection, needs verification
- SNR < 7: Poor quality, might be noise

FACTORS AFFECTING SNR:
- Star brightness (brighter = better SNR)
- Planet size (bigger = deeper transit = better SNR)
- Telescope sensitivity
- Observation duration
- Number of transits observed

TOOLS:
- Automated detection algorithms (BLS - Box Least Squares)
- Statistical analysis of photometric data
- Wavelet analysis for noise characterization


================================================================================
METRIC 5: STELLAR MASS
================================================================================

HOW TO MEASURE:
Use spectroscopy and stellar models to estimate the star's mass.

PRIMARY METHOD - SPECTROSCOPY:
1. Observe star's spectrum (light split into colors)
2. Identify absorption lines (dark lines in spectrum)
3. Measure line strengths and widths
4. Compare to stellar models

WHAT SPECTROSCOPY TELLS YOU:
- Stellar temperature (from color/spectrum shape)
- Surface gravity (from pressure-broadened lines)
- Metallicity (from abundance of elements)
- Rotation speed (from Doppler broadening)

THEN USE STELLAR MODELS:
Combine temperature + surface gravity + metallicity
→ Stellar evolution models tell you mass

EXAMPLE (Kepler-22):
- Spectrum shows: T_eff = 5627 K (slightly cooler than Sun)
- Surface gravity: log(g) = 4.45 (similar to Sun)
- Metallicity: [Fe/H] = -0.29 (less metal than Sun)
→ Stellar models: M = 0.97 ± 0.06 solar masses

ALTERNATIVE METHOD - ASTEROSEISMOLOGY:
Listen to star's oscillations (stellar earthquakes):
- Star vibrates at specific frequencies
- Frequencies depend on mass and internal structure
- Very accurate: ±3% mass uncertainty

TOOLS:
- High-resolution spectrographs (HARPS, HIRES)
- Stellar model grids (MESA, Dartmouth)
- Asteroseismic analysis (Kepler data)

TYPICAL ACCURACY:
- Spectroscopy: ±10-20%
- Asteroseismology: ±3-5%
- Binary stars: ±1% (from orbit)


================================================================================
METRIC 6: STELLAR TEMPERATURE
================================================================================

HOW TO MEASURE:
Analyze the star's color and spectrum.

METHOD 1 - COLOR/PHOTOMETRY:
Measure star's brightness in different color filters:
- Blue filter (B)
- Visual filter (V)
- Red filter (R)
- Infrared filter (I)

Hotter stars are bluer, cooler stars are redder.

Color Index: B-V (blue brightness minus visual brightness)
- B-V = -0.3: Hot blue star (~25,000 K)
- B-V = 0.0: White star (~10,000 K)
- B-V = 0.6: Yellow star like Sun (~5,800 K)
- B-V = 1.5: Cool red star (~3,500 K)

METHOD 2 - SPECTROSCOPY (MORE ACCURATE):
1. Observe star's spectrum
2. Look at spectral lines (hydrogen, calcium, iron)
3. Line ratios tell you temperature
4. Match to spectral type (O, B, A, F, G, K, M)

SPECTRAL TYPES:
- O: 30,000+ K (very hot, blue)
- B: 10,000-30,000 K (hot, blue-white)
- A: 7,500-10,000 K (white)
- F: 6,000-7,500 K (yellow-white)
- G: 5,200-6,000 K (yellow) ← Sun is G2 (5,778 K)
- K: 3,700-5,200 K (orange)
- M: 2,400-3,700 K (red)

EXAMPLE (Kepler-22):
- Color: B-V = 0.87 (slightly redder than Sun)
- Spectral type: G5V
- Temperature: 5,627 ± 44 K

METHOD 3 - SED FITTING:
Fit entire Spectral Energy Distribution:
- Measure brightness at many wavelengths (UV to infrared)
- Fit blackbody curve or stellar model
- Temperature from best-fit curve

TOOLS:
- Multi-band photometry (Sloan filters: u, g, r, i, z)
- High-resolution spectrographs
- Infrared surveys (2MASS, WISE)

ACCURACY:
- Photometry: ±200 K
- Spectroscopy: ±50-100 K
- Detailed analysis: ±20-50 K


================================================================================
METRIC 7: STELLAR MAGNITUDE
================================================================================

HOW TO MEASURE:
Measure how bright the star appears from Earth.

DEFINITION:
Apparent magnitude = How bright the star looks to us
- Brighter stars: Lower numbers (magnitude 1 = very bright)
- Fainter stars: Higher numbers (magnitude 20 = very faint)
- Each magnitude = 2.512× brightness difference

MAGNITUDE SCALE EXAMPLES:
- Sun: -26.7 (extremely bright)
- Full Moon: -12.6
- Venus: -4.4
- Sirius (brightest star): -1.46
- Naked eye limit: +6
- Kepler targets: +8 to +16
- Kepler-22: +11.7 (needs telescope)
- Hubble limit: +31

HOW TO MEASURE:
1. Point telescope at star
2. Collect light with CCD camera
3. Count photons over fixed time
4. Compare to standard reference stars
5. Apply corrections for:
   - Atmospheric extinction
   - Instrumental effects
   - Extinction by dust

FORMULA:
    m₁ - m₂ = -2.5 × log₁₀(F₁ / F₂)
    
    Where:
        m = apparent magnitude
        F = measured flux (photons/second)

EXAMPLE:
You measure star X is 100× fainter than reference star (magnitude 10):
    m_X - 10 = -2.5 × log₁₀(1/100)
    m_X - 10 = -2.5 × (-2)
    m_X = 10 + 5 = 15

DIFFERENT MAGNITUDE SYSTEMS:
- V-band (visual, ~550 nm): Most common
- R-band (red, ~650 nm)
- Kepler-band (420-900 nm, very broad)
- TESS-band (600-1000 nm, red-heavy)

TOOLS:
- CCD photometry
- Calibrated against standard star catalogs
- Automated pipelines (SDSS, Pan-STARRS)

ACCURACY:
Professional telescopes: ±0.01 magnitudes

WHY IT MATTERS FOR ML:
Brighter stars → Better data quality → Higher SNR
The system needs to know if low SNR is because:
- Star is faint (expected)
- Or detection is poor quality (concerning)
